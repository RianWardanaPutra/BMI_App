Body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of a person.
The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height,
and is universally expressed in units of kg/m<sup>2</sup>,
resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres.[(wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index)
